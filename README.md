# vst-parameters
This repository contains dictionary data for vst plugin parameters for use with FL Studio MIDI scripting.

Update: 1/19/2022:

-I've found it more useful to reverse the key/value from how they were set originally so now I'll add them with the name of the parameter as the key and the number as the value.
-Also added the code to create the dicts.
